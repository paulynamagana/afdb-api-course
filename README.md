This repository contains Google Colab notebooks developed as part of the **EMBL-EBI course "From sequences to structures: Protein characterisation using EMBL-EBI APIs 2025"**.

---

## About This Repository

This collection of notebooks offers practical, hands-on tutorials for interacting with EMBL-EBI's powerful bioinformatics APIs. The primary focus is on the **AlphaFold Database API**, enabling researchers and students to programmatically access, retrieve, and utilise predicted protein structure data.

## Notebooks Overview

### `alphafold-api-introduction.ipynb`

This notebook serves as the foundational introduction to the AlphaFold Database API. It covers:
* **API Request Formulation:** How to construct and send basic API requests to retrieve protein structure prediction data.
* **Response Interpretation:** Understanding the structure and content of the data returned by the API.
* **Programmatic Downloads:** Methods for downloading protein structure files (PDB, CIF) and associated data (such as Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) images and AlphaMissense annotations) directly to your Google Drive.

## Course Context

These materials are directly aligned with the learning objectives of the EMBL-EBI course: **"From sequences to structures: Protein characterisation using EMBL-EBI APIs 2025"**.
For more information about the course, please refer to the official [EMBL-EBI Training website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/materials/from-sequences-to-structures-handbook/)

## Getting Started

To begin using these notebooks:
1.  **Open in Colab:** Click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of this `README.md` (or next to the specific notebook in the "Notebooks Overview" section) to launch the notebook directly in Google Colab.
2.  **Run Cells:** Execute the code cells sequentially. Follow any inline instructions within the notebook for making API calls and interacting with the data.
3.  **Google Account:** Ensure you are logged into your Google account to save your progress, or if the notebook requires mounting Google Drive for file downloads.
